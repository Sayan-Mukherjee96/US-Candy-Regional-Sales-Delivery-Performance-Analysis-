This project analyzes regional sales trends, delivery performance, and logistics efficiency for a candy distribution network. Using data from multiple regions, factories, and shipping modes, the goal is to uncover operational patterns and provide actionable insights to improve delivery speed, reduce delays, and optimize shipping strategies.

📁 Project Overview

The analysis focuses on understanding:

🔹 Regional Delivery Performance:

Average delivery time by region and state

Delay percentage across regions

Identification of the most time-consuming factory-to-region routes

🔹 Shipping Mode Efficiency:

Comparison of on-time performance across Standard, Second Class, First Class, and Same Day shipping

Cost vs. performance evaluation

🔹 Seasonal Delay Trends:

Months with consistently high delays (e.g., January, April, November)

Year-over-year changes in delivery performance

🔹 Factory Proximity Impact:

Comparison of delivery speed between Local vs. Far factory shipments

Identification of regions where proximity does not improve delivery times

📈 Key Insights:

Delivery delays vary significantly across months and regions

Some routes (Factory → Region) consistently show higher delay percentages

Same Day shipping performs best in both cost and punctuality

Factory proximity has minimal effect on delivery time in most regions

Certain states experience unusually long delivery durations due to logistical constraints

💡 Recommendations (Data Analyst Perspective):

Optimize route planning using data-driven algorithms

Forecast high-demand months and allocate resources proactively

Use Same Day shipping structure as a benchmark to improve other modes

Implement GPS-based dashboards for real-time delay monitoring

Automate sorting and dispatching to reduce manual handling errors

Strengthen cross-regional logistic coordination

Update future datasets to include customer-level delivery feedback

🛠 Tools & Technologies:

Power BI — dashboards, data modeling, DAX calculations

Excel / CSV — dataset preparation

Power Query — data cleaning and ETL

DAX — complex measures and KPI calculations

📂 Result:

A fully interactive Power BI dashboard that helps identify:

Delay hotspots

Inefficient routes

High-performing shipping methods

Seasonal patterns

Regional delivery performance
