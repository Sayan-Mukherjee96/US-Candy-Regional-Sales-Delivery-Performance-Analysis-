**Project Overview**



The analysis covers the following areas:



**📍 Regional Delivery Performance**



Average delivery time at both regional and state levels



Percentage of late deliveries by region



Identification of factory-to-region routes that cause the longest delivery delays



🚚 **Shipping Mode Efficiency**



Comparison of on-time performance across Standard, Second Class, First Class, and Same Day shipping



Cost vs. performance evaluation to understand economic trade-offs



📅 **Seasonal Delay Trends**



Months with consistently high delay rates (January, April, November)



Year-over-year changes in delivery performance



🏭 **Factory Proximity Impact**



Comparison between Local vs Far factory delivery performance



Regions where proximity does not improve delivery times



**Key Insights**



Delivery delays vary significantly by month and by region.



Certain factory-to-region routes consistently show the highest delay percentages.



Same Day shipping offers the strongest balance of cost and on-time performance.



Factory proximity has minimal impact on delivery time in most regions.



A few states show unusually long delivery times due to logistical constraints.



**Recommendations (Data Analyst Perspective)**



Implement data-driven route optimization algorithms.



Forecast high-demand months and allocate resources in advance.



Use the efficiency of Same Day shipping as a benchmark for other shipping modes.



Deploy GPS-based dashboards to monitor delays in real time.



Automate sorting and dispatching processes to reduce human errors.



Improve cross-regional coordination by sharing logistics performance reports.



Expand future datasets to include customer delivery feedback for deeper analysis.



**Tools \& Technologies**



Power BI – dashboards, data modeling, DAX measures



Excel / CSV – dataset preparation



Power Query – data cleaning and ETL



DAX – KPI calculations and advanced business metrics



**Result**



The project delivers a fully interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights:



Delay hotspots



Inefficient delivery routes



High-performing shipping methods



Seasonal delay patterns



Regional delivery performance insights



✅ Yes — now it is correct, clean, and professional.



If you want, I can also create:

✔ A shorter GitHub version

✔ A more formal academic version

✔ A visually formatted README with emojis and section dividers
